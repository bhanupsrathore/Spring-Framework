Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build lifecycle.




A settings.xml file is usually found in a couple of places:

Global settings in Mavens home directory: ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml
User settings in the user’s home: ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml
If both files exist, their contents are merged. Configurations from the user settings take precedence.
